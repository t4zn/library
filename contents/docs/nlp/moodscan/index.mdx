title: Sentiment Analysis
description: Analyze the sentiment of text (positive, negative, neutral).
---

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Usage

```python
import taizun as tz
sentiment = tz.moodscan("I love this library!")
print(sentiment)
```

## Theory

Sentiment analysis involves classifying text into sentiment categories, typically positive, negative, or neutral. More advanced systems can detect specific emotions like joy, anger, fear, or surprise.

The main approaches include:

1. **Lexicon-based methods**: Use predefined dictionaries of words with associated sentiment scores. Each word in the text is looked up, and the overall sentiment is calculated from these scores.

2. **Machine learning methods**: Train classifiers on labeled datasets of text with known sentiments. Features like bag-of-words or TF-IDF vectors are extracted and used with algorithms like Naive Bayes or SVM.

3. **Deep learning methods**: Employ neural networks like RNNs or transformer models (BERT) that can capture contextual information and complex linguistic patterns.

The choice of approach depends on the application requirements, available training data, and desired accuracy. Deep learning methods generally provide the best performance but require more computational resources.
