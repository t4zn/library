title: Sentiment Analysis
description: Analyze the sentiment of text (positive, negative, neutral).
---

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Usage

```python
import taizun as tz
sentiment = tz.moodscan("I love this library!")
print(sentiment)
```

## Theory

Sentiment analysis involves classifying text into sentiment categories, typically positive, negative, or neutral. More advanced systems can detect specific emotions like joy, anger, fear, or surprise.

The main approaches include:

1. **Lexicon-based methods**: Use predefined dictionaries of words with associated sentiment scores. Each word in the text is looked up, and the overall sentiment is calculated from these scores.

2. **Machine learning methods**: Train classifiers on labeled datasets of text with known sentiments. Features like bag-of-words or TF-IDF vectors are extracted and used with algorithms like Naive Bayes or SVM.

3. **Deep learning methods**: Employ neural networks like RNNs or transformer models (BERT) that can capture contextual information and complex linguistic patterns.

The choice of approach depends on the application requirements, available training data, and desired accuracy. Deep learning methods generally provide the best performance but require more computational resources.

## Real-World Example

E-commerce companies extensively use sentiment analysis to monitor customer reviews and feedback about their products. This helps them understand customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement:

```python
import taizun as tz

# Customer reviews for a smartphone
reviews = [
    "The battery life is amazing and the camera quality is outstanding! Highly recommend.",
    "Terrible experience. Phone keeps freezing and the screen cracked within a week.",
    "Average phone. Good features but nothing exceptional. Decent price though.",
    "Best purchase I've made this year! Fast processor and beautiful display.",
    "Not worth the money. Overpriced and underperforming compared to competitors."
]

# Analyze sentiment of each review
print("Customer Review Sentiment Analysis:")
print("=" * 40)

for i, review in enumerate(reviews, 1):
    sentiment = tz.moodscan(review)
    print(f"Review {i}: {sentiment}")
    print(f"Text: {review[:50]}{'...' if len(review) > 50 else ''}")
    print("-" * 30)

# Output might be:
# Review 1: Positive
# Review 2: Negative
# Review 3: Neutral
# Review 4: Positive
# Review 5: Negative

# Calculate overall sentiment score
positive_reviews = sum(1 for review in reviews if tz.moodscan(review) == "Positive")
negative_reviews = sum(1 for review in reviews if tz.moodscan(review) == "Negative")
neutral_reviews = sum(1 for review in reviews if tz.moodscan(review) == "Neutral")

print(f"\nOverall Sentiment Summary:")
print(f"Positive: {positive_reviews}/{len(reviews)} ({positive_reviews/len(reviews)*100:.1f}%)")
print(f"Negative: {negative_reviews}/{len(reviews)} ({negative_reviews/len(reviews)*100:.1f}%)")
print(f"Neutral: {neutral_reviews}/{len(reviews)} ({neutral_reviews/len(reviews)*100:.1f}%)")
```

This kind of analysis enables businesses to make data-driven decisions about product improvements, marketing strategies, and customer service enhancements.
