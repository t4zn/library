This section covers various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and their practical implementations.

## Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## Key Areas

- Text Processing
- Sentiment Analysis
- Named Entity Recognition
- Language Modeling
- Machine Translation

Explore the subsections to learn more about each area and how to implement them in your projects.

## Detailed Theory

Natural Language Processing combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. These technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and understand its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer's intent and sentiment.

### Core Components of NLP

1. **Morphological and Lexical Analysis**: Breaking down text into words, identifying parts of speech, and recognizing entities.
2. **Syntactic Analysis**: Understanding the grammatical structure of sentences.
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Extracting meaning from text.
4. **Discourse Integration**: Understanding context and relationships between sentences.
5. **Pragmatic Analysis**: Understanding the intended meaning considering the real-world context.

NLP has evolved significantly with the advent of deep learning, particularly transformer models like BERT, GPT, and T5, which have revolutionized the field by achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
