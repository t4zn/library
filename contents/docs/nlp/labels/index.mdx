## Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

## Usage

```python
import taizun as tz
entities = tz.labels("Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States.")
print(entities)
```

## Theory

NER is typically modeled as a sequence labeling task where each token (word) in a sentence is assigned a label from a predefined set of entity types. Common approaches include:

1. **Rule-based systems**: Use handcrafted rules and patterns, often combined with dictionaries and gazetteers.

2. **Machine learning models**: Feature-based classifiers like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) that consider contextual features of words.

3. **Deep learning models**: Neural architectures like BiLSTM-CRF or transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) that can capture complex linguistic patterns.

Modern NER systems achieve high accuracy by combining multiple approaches and leveraging large annotated datasets. The performance often depends on the domain and language of the text being processed.
