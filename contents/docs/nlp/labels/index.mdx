description: Identify entities like people, locations, and organizations in text.

## Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

## Usage

```python
import taizun as tz
entities = tz.labels("Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States.")
print(entities)
```

## Theory

NER is typically modeled as a sequence labeling task where each token (word) in a sentence is assigned a label from a predefined set of entity types. Common approaches include:

1. **Rule-based systems**: Use handcrafted rules and patterns, often combined with dictionaries and gazetteers.

2. **Machine learning models**: Feature-based classifiers like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) that consider contextual features of words.

3. **Deep learning models**: Neural architectures like BiLSTM-CRF or transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) that can capture complex linguistic patterns.

Modern NER systems achieve high accuracy by combining multiple approaches and leveraging large annotated datasets. The performance often depends on the domain and language of the text being processed.

## Real-World Example

News organizations and intelligence agencies use NER to automatically extract key information from large volumes of text documents. This helps in organizing information and identifying important entities:

```python
import taizun as tz

# News article about international business deal
news_text = """
Apple Inc. announced yesterday that CEO Tim Cook will visit Tokyo next month 
to discuss a potential partnership with Sony Corporation. The meeting is scheduled 
for March 15, 2024, at Sony's headquarters in Minato, Tokyo. Apple plans to invest 
$2.5 billion in the joint venture, which will focus on developing augmented reality 
technology for the Asian market. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida welcomed 
the investment, stating it would create approximately 3,000 jobs in the region.
"""

# Extract named entities
entities = tz.labels(news_text)

print("Named Entities Identified:")
print("=" * 30)
for entity in entities:
    print(f"Entity: {entity}")

# Typical output might include:
# Organization: Apple Inc.
# Person: Tim Cook
# Location: Tokyo
# Date: March 15, 2024
# Organization: Sony Corporation
# Location: Minato
# Location: Tokyo
# Monetary Value: $2.5 billion
# Person: Fumio Kishida
# Location: Asian market
# Quantity: 3,000 jobs

# Process entities by category
organizations = [e for e in entities if "Inc." in e or "Corporation" in e]
people = [e for e in entities if any(name in e for name in ["Tim Cook", "Fumio Kishida"])]
locations = [e for e in entities if e in ["Tokyo", "Minato", "Asian market"]]
dates = [e for e in entities if "2024" in e]
monetary_values = [e for e in entities if "$" in e or "billion" in e]

print("\nCategorized Entities:")
print("=" * 20)
print(f"Organizations: {organizations}")
print(f"People: {people}")
print(f"Locations: {locations}")
print(f"Dates: {dates}")
print(f"Monetary Values: {monetary_values}")
```

This automated entity extraction enables newsrooms to quickly index articles, create knowledge graphs, and facilitate advanced search capabilities across their content repositories.
