title: Word Frequency Analysis
description: Analyze the frequency of words in a text.

## Overview

Word frequency analysis is the process of counting how often each word appears in a text document. This technique is fundamental in text mining and helps identify the most important terms in a document.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import word_frequency_analysis
frequency = word_frequency_analysis("This is a test. This test is only a test.")
print(frequency)
```

## Theory

Word frequency analysis is based on the principle that important words in a document will appear more frequently than less important ones. The process involves:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaking the text into individual words or tokens.

2. **Normalization**: Converting words to a standard form (lowercase, stemming) to ensure consistent counting.

3. **Counting**: Maintaining a frequency count for each unique word.

4. **Analysis**: Interpreting the results to identify key terms, patterns, or topics.

This technique is used in various applications including:
- Keyword extraction for search engines
- Text summarization
- Authorship attribution
- Language modeling
- Information retrieval

Advanced approaches may consider n-grams (sequences of n words) rather than just individual words, and may apply weighting schemes like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to better reflect word importance.
