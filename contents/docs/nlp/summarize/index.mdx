title: Text Summarization
description: Summarize long texts into concise, readable summaries.

## Overview

Text summarization is the process of creating a shorter version of a text document while preserving its key information and meaning. This technique is valuable for processing large volumes of text efficiently.

## Usage

```python
import taizun as tz
summary = tz.summarize("Your long text here...")
print(summary)
```

## Theory

Text summarization techniques fall into two main categories:

1. **Extractive Summarization**: Selects and combines the most important sentences or phrases from the original text. It works by identifying significant sentences based on factors like sentence position, keyword frequency, and similarity to the main theme.

2. **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates new sentences that capture the essence of the original text, often using natural language generation techniques. This approach can paraphrase and restructure content to create more concise summaries.

The choice between extractive and abstractive methods depends on the desired balance between accuracy and fluency. Extractive methods are generally more reliable but may produce less readable summaries, while abstractive methods can generate more natural language but may introduce inaccuracies.

## Real-World Example

News organizations frequently use text summarization to create brief headlines and article summaries for their websites. For example, a news aggregator might process hundreds of articles daily to provide concise summaries to readers:

```python
import taizun as tz

# Sample news article
news_article = """
Climate scientists have issued a stark warning about rising global temperatures, 
predicting that without immediate action, the world could face catastrophic 
consequences including extreme weather events, sea level rise, and ecosystem collapse. 
The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates 
that global temperatures have already risen by 1.1째C above pre-industrial levels, 
and are on track to exceed the critical threshold of 1.5째C within the next two decades. 
Experts emphasize that reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to renewable energy 
sources are essential steps to mitigate these effects. Governments worldwide are being 
urged to implement more aggressive climate policies and invest heavily in sustainable 
technologies to prevent irreversible damage to our planet.
"""

# Generate summary
summary = tz.summarize(news_article)
print("Article Summary:")
print(summary)

# Output might be:
# "Climate scientists warn of catastrophic consequences from rising global temperatures. 
# IPCC report shows 1.1째C increase already occurred, with 1.5째C threshold expected 
# to be exceeded within two decades. Experts recommend reducing carbon emissions and 
# transitioning to renewable energy sources."
```

This approach helps news platforms efficiently process large volumes of content while 
maintaining the essential information for their readers.
