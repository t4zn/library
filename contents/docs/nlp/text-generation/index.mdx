title: Text Generation
description: Generate text from a prompt using GPT-2.

## Overview

Text generation is the process of automatically creating new text content based on a given prompt or context. This technique uses language models to produce human-like text that continues from or relates to the input prompt.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import text_generation
generated_text = text_generation("Once upon a time,")
print(generated_text)
```

## Theory

Text generation relies on language models that have been trained on vast amounts of text data to learn patterns of human language. These models predict the next word in a sequence based on the context provided by previous words.

Modern approaches include:

1. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Process sequences one token at a time, maintaining hidden state information.

2. **Transformer Models**: Use self-attention mechanisms to process all tokens simultaneously while capturing long-range dependencies.

3. **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for guiding the generation process through carefully crafted input prompts.

The quality of generated text depends on the model's training data, size, and architecture. Generated text can be controlled through parameters like temperature, which affects randomness, and top-k or nucleus sampling, which influence diversity.
