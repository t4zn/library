title: Split String
description: Split a string into a list of substrings.
---

## Overview

The split string function divides a string into multiple substrings based on a specified delimiter, returning a list of the resulting pieces. This operation is fundamental for parsing structured text data.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import split_string
split_string_input = "Hello World"
result = split_string(split_string_input)
print(result)
```

## Theory

String splitting is the inverse of joining operations, breaking a continuous string into discrete components based on separator characters or patterns.

Key parameters:
1. **Delimiter**: Character or string that marks boundaries between parts
2. **Maximum splits**: Limit on the number of divisions to perform
3. **Behavior flags**: Options for handling empty parts and edge cases

Common splitting patterns:
- **Whitespace splitting**: Dividing on spaces, tabs, and line breaks
- **Character splitting**: Using specific characters like commas or semicolons
- **Pattern splitting**: Using regular expressions for complex delimiters
- **Fixed-width splitting**: Dividing at specific positions regardless of content

Applications include:
- **CSV processing**: Parsing comma-separated values into data structures
- **Command parsing**: Breaking user input into commands and arguments
- **Path manipulation**: Separating directory components in file paths
- **Data extraction**: Isolating fields from structured text formats
- **Natural language processing**: Tokenizing sentences into words
- **Configuration parsing**: Processing key-value pairs and settings

Implementation considerations:
- **Edge cases**: Handling empty strings, missing delimiters, and consecutive separators
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms for large text processing
- **Memory usage**: Managing the creation of multiple substring objects
- **Unicode support**: Proper handling of international characters and combining marks

In programming:
```python
# Basic splitting
parts = text.split()           # Split on whitespace
parts = text.split(",")        # Split on comma
parts = text.split(",", 2)     # Limit to 2 splits
# Advanced splitting
parts = text.splitlines()      # Split on line boundaries
parts = re.split(pattern, text)  # Split using regular expressions
```
