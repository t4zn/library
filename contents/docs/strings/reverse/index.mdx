title: Reverse
description: Reverse a string.

## Overview

The reverse function takes a string and returns a new string with the characters in reverse order. This operation is fundamental in text processing and string manipulation algorithms.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import reverse
text_input = "hello"
result = reverse(text_input)
print(result)
```

## Theory

String reversal is a basic operation that inverts the order of characters in a sequence. For a string of length n with characters at positions 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, the reversed string has characters at positions n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0.

Key properties:
1. **Involution**: Reversing a string twice returns the original string
2. **Length preservation**: The reversed string has the same length as the original
3. **Character preservation**: All characters are preserved, only their order changes

Algorithmic approaches:
1. **Two-pointer method**: Swap characters from both ends moving toward the center
2. **Stack-based**: Push all characters onto a stack, then pop them off
3. **Recursion**: Reverse the substring excluding first character, then append first character
4. **Built-in functions**: Most programming languages provide optimized reversal functions

Applications include:
- **Palindrome detection**: Checking if a string equals its reverse
- **Text processing**: Formatting and data transformation
- **Cryptography**: Simple character scrambling operations
- **Algorithm problems**: Common interview questions and coding challenges
- **Bioinformatics**: DNA sequence analysis (complementary sequences)
- **User interfaces**: Text display in right-to-left languages

Implementation considerations:
- **Unicode handling**: Proper handling of multi-byte characters and combining marks
- **Memory efficiency**: In-place vs. new string creation
- **Performance**: O(n) time complexity is optimal for this operation
- **Immutability**: String reversal in languages with immutable strings creates new objects

In programming:
```python
# Python slicing
reversed_string = original[::-1]
# or built-in function
reversed_string = ''.join(reversed(original))
```
