Pattern matching is the process of checking a given sequence of tokens for the presence of a specific pattern or structure.

## Overview

Pattern matching is a fundamental operation in computer science used in various applications such as text processing, data validation, and lexical analysis.

## Common Algorithms

- Naive string matching
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm
- Boyer-Moore algorithm
- Rabin-Karp algorithm
- Regular expression matching

Pattern matching is essential for tasks like searching, parsing, and validating data formats.
