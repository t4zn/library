title: Uppercase
description: Convert a string to uppercase.

## Overview

The uppercase function converts all alphabetic characters in a string to their uppercase equivalents. This operation is commonly used for emphasis, acronyms, and standardized text formatting.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import uppercase
uppercase_string = "hello"
result = uppercase(uppercase_string)
print(result)
```

## Theory

Uppercase conversion transforms alphabetic characters to their capital letter forms. This operation is the inverse of lowercase conversion and follows language-specific rules for character mapping.

Key properties:
1. **Idempotence**: Applying uppercase twice yields the same result as applying it once
2. **Character preservation**: Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged
3. **Length preservation**: The output string has the same length as the input

Unicode complexities:
- **Simple mappings**: Direct one-to-one character conversions (A-Z, a-z)
- **Expansion mappings**: Some lowercase characters map to multiple uppercase characters
- **Language-specific rules**: German ß becomes SS, Turkish i/İ handling
- **Special cases**: Ligatures and composed characters may require special treatment

Applications include:
- **Emphasis formatting**: Making text stand out in user interfaces
- **Acronym creation**: Standardizing abbreviations and initialisms
- **Data entry standardization**: Consistent formatting for codes and identifiers
- **Title formatting**: Creating headers and section titles
- **Accessibility**: Improving readability for users with certain visual impairments
- **Protocol compliance**: Meeting requirements for specific data formats

Implementation considerations:
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient algorithms for large text processing
- **Memory management**: In-place vs. new string creation strategies
- **Unicode compliance**: Proper handling of international character sets
- **Locale sensitivity**: Respecting language-specific conversion rules

In programming:
```python
# Built-in methods
uppercased = text.upper()
# Locale-sensitive versions
uppercased = text.uppercase(locale)
```
