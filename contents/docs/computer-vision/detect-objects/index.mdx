title: Detect Objects
description: Detect objects in an image with bounding boxes and labels.
---

## Overview

Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within images or videos. Unlike image classification, which assigns a single label to an entire image, object detection finds multiple objects and specifies their positions using bounding boxes.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import detect_objects
objects = detect_objects("path/to/image.jpg")
print(objects)
```

## Theory

Object detection combines image classification with object localization. The main challenges include:

1. **Localization**: Determining the precise position of objects using bounding boxes (defined by coordinates).

2. **Classification**: Identifying what each detected object is from a set of predefined categories.

3. **Scale Variation**: Handling objects of different sizes within the same image.

4. ** Occlusion**: Dealing with partially visible objects.

The main approaches to object detection are:

1. **Two-Stage Detectors**: First generate region proposals, then classify and refine them. R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN are prominent examples.

2. **Single-Stage Detectors**: Directly predict object classes and bounding boxes in one pass. YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) are popular approaches.

3. **Transformer-Based Detectors**: Recent approaches like DETR (DEtection TRansformer) use transformer architectures for end-to-end object detection.

Modern object detection systems achieve real-time performance with high accuracy, making them suitable for applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.
