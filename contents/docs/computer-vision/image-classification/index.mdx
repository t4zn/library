Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning a label or category to an entire image.

## Overview

Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules. The categorization law can be selected based on the problem at hand.

## Common Approaches

- Traditional machine learning approaches (SVM, Random Forest)
- Deep learning approaches (CNNs)
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Ensemble methods

Image classification has applications in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and content-based image retrieval.
