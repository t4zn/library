title: Detect Objects
description: Detect objects in an image with bounding boxes and labels.
---

## Overview

Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within images or videos. Unlike image classification, which assigns a single label to an entire image, object detection finds multiple objects and specifies their positions using bounding boxes.

## Usage

```python
import taizun as tz
objects = tz.spot("path/to/image.jpg")
print(objects)
```

## Theory

Object detection combines image classification with object localization. The main challenges include:

1. **Localization**: Determining the precise position of objects using bounding boxes (defined by coordinates).

2. **Classification**: Identifying what each detected object is from a set of predefined categories.

3. **Scale Variation**: Handling objects of different sizes within the same image.

4. **Occlusion**: Dealing with partially visible objects.

The main approaches to object detection are:

1. **Two-Stage Detectors**: First generate region proposals, then classify and refine them. R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN are prominent examples.

2. **Single-Stage Detectors**: Directly predict object classes and bounding boxes in one pass. YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) are popular approaches.

3. **Transformer-Based Detectors**: Recent approaches like DETR (DEtection TRansformer) use transformer architectures for end-to-end object detection.

Modern object detection systems achieve real-time performance with high accuracy, making them suitable for applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.

## Real-World Example

Autonomous vehicles and traffic monitoring systems use object detection to identify and track vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects in real-time for safe navigation and traffic analysis:

```python
import taizun as tz

# Traffic camera images for analysis
traffic_images = [
    "intersection_01.jpg",
    "highway_01.jpg",
    "pedestrian_crossing_01.jpg",
    "parking_lot_01.jpg"
]

print("Traffic Monitoring and Analysis:")
print("=" * 35)

# Process each traffic image
for image_path in traffic_images:
    try:
        # Detect objects in the traffic scene
        detected_objects = tz.spot(image_path)
        
        print(f"Scene: {image_path}")
        print("Detected Objects:")
        
        # Categorize detected objects
        vehicles = [obj for obj in detected_objects if obj in ["car", "truck", "bus", "motorcycle"]]
        pedestrians = [obj for obj in detected_objects if obj in ["person", "pedestrian"]]
        traffic_signs = [obj for obj in detected_objects if obj in ["traffic light", "stop sign", "traffic sign"]]
        bicycles = [obj for obj in detected_objects if obj in ["bicycle", "bike"]]
        
        print(f"  Vehicles: {len(vehicles)} ({', '.join(vehicles) if vehicles else 'None'})")
        print(f"  Pedestrians: {len(pedestrians)} ({', '.join(pedestrians) if pedestrians else 'None'})")
        print(f"  Traffic Signs: {len(traffic_signs)} ({', '.join(traffic_signs) if traffic_signs else 'None'})")
        print(f"  Bicycles: {len(bicycles)} ({', '.join(bicycles) if bicycles else 'None'})")
        
        # Traffic density analysis
        total_objects = len(detected_objects)
        vehicle_density = len(vehicles) / total_objects if total_objects > 0 else 0
        
        print(f"  Total Objects: {total_objects}")
        print(f"  Vehicle Density: {vehicle_density:.1%}")
        
        # Safety alerts
        if len(pedestrians) > 0 and len(vehicles) > 3:
            print("  ⚠️  Safety Alert: High pedestrian-vehicle interaction area")
        if len(traffic_signs) == 0:
            print("  ⚠️  Notice: No traffic signs detected - potential signage issue")
        if len(bicycles) > 2:
            print("  ℹ️  Info: High bicycle activity area")
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {image_path}: {str(e)}")
    
    print("-" * 40)

# Generate traffic report
print("Traffic Analysis Summary:")
print("=" * 25)
print("This system helps traffic engineers:")
print("1. Optimize traffic light timing based on vehicle density")
print("2. Identify high-risk intersections for pedestrian safety")
print("3. Plan infrastructure improvements for bicycle lanes")
print("4. Monitor traffic patterns for urban planning")
```

This object detection system enables smart city infrastructure to automatically monitor traffic conditions, improve safety, and optimize traffic flow without human intervention.
