Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects within images or videos.

## Overview

Object detection combines image classification with object localization to not only classify objects in an image but also determine their precise locations using bounding boxes.

## Popular Models

- R-CNN family (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN)
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)
- RetinaNet

Object detection is used in applications like surveillance, autonomous driving, and facial recognition.
