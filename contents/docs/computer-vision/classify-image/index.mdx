title: Classify Image
description: Classify an image using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

## Overview

Image classification is the task of assigning a label or category to an entire image. This fundamental computer vision task is used in many applications, from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles.

## Usage

```python
import taizun as tz
label = tz.classify_image("path/to/image.jpg")
print(label)
```

## Theory

Image classification involves training a model to recognize specific patterns and features in images that correspond to different classes or categories. The main approaches include:

1. **Traditional Methods**: Early approaches used handcrafted features like SIFT, HOG, or color histograms combined with classifiers like SVM or Random Forest.

2. **Deep Learning**: Modern approaches use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that automatically learn relevant features from raw pixel data. Architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet have achieved remarkable performance.

3. **Vision Transformers**: Recent advances use transformer architectures adapted for vision tasks. Vision Transformers (ViT) divide images into patches and process them with self-attention mechanisms, often achieving state-of-the-art results.

The training process requires a large dataset of labeled images. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and color adjustments are often used to improve model generalization. Transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a specific task, is commonly used to achieve good results with limited data.

## Real-World Example

Medical imaging systems use image classification to automatically detect abnormalities in X-rays, MRIs, and other diagnostic images, helping radiologists identify potential health issues more efficiently:

```python
import taizun as tz

# Medical X-ray images for classification
xray_images = [
    "patient_001_chest_xray.jpg",
    "patient_002_chest_xray.jpg",
    "patient_003_chest_xray.jpg",
    "patient_004_chest_xray.jpg",
    "patient_005_chest_xray.jpg"
]

print("Automated Medical Image Classification:")
print("=" * 40)

# Process each X-ray image
results = []
for image_path in xray_images:
    try:
        # Classify the medical image
        classification = tz.classify_image(image_path)
        confidence = 0.95  # Simulated confidence score
        
        print(f"Patient Image: {image_path}")
        print(f"Diagnosis: {classification}")
        print(f"Confidence: {confidence:.2%}")
        print("-" * 30)
        
        results.append({
            "patient": image_path,
            "diagnosis": classification,
            "confidence": confidence
        })
        
        # Flag potentially critical cases
        if classification in ["Pneumonia", "Lung Cancer", "Cardiomegaly"] and confidence > 0.8:
            print("⚠️  ALERT: Critical finding detected - Requires immediate radiologist review")
        elif classification in ["Emphysema", "Pleural Effusion"] and confidence > 0.7:
            print("⚠️  NOTICE: Significant finding - Should be reviewed by radiologist")
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {image_path}: {str(e)}")
    
    print()

# Generate diagnostic report
normal_cases = [r for r in results if r["diagnosis"] == "Normal"]
abnormal_cases = [r for r in results if r["diagnosis"] != "Normal"]

print("Diagnostic Summary:")
print("=" * 20)
print(f"Total cases processed: {len(results)}")
print(f"Normal findings: {len(normal_cases)}")
print(f"Abnormal findings: {len(abnormal_cases)}")
print(f"Accuracy rate: {(len(normal_cases) * 0.95 + len(abnormal_cases) * 0.90) / len(results):.1%}")

# Prioritize cases for review
high_confidence_abnormal = [r for r in abnormal_cases if r["confidence"] > 0.9]
print(f"\nHigh-confidence abnormal cases requiring immediate review: {len(high_confidence_abnormal)}")

for case in high_confidence_abnormal:
    print(f"  - {case['patient']}: {case['diagnosis']} ({case['confidence']:.1%} confidence)")
```

This automated classification system helps medical professionals prioritize cases, reduce diagnostic time, and ensure critical findings are not overlooked in busy clinical environments.
