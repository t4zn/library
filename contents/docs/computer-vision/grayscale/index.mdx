title: Convert to Grayscale
description: Convert an image to grayscale.
---

## Overview

Grayscale conversion transforms a color image into a monochrome version by removing hue and saturation information while preserving luminance. This operation reduces data complexity and is often used as a preprocessing step in computer vision tasks.

## Usage

```python
import taizun as tz
tz.grayscale("path/to/image.jpg", "path/to/output_grayscale.jpg")
```

## Theory

Grayscale conversion involves transforming RGB color values to a single intensity value per pixel. The most common approach uses a weighted sum that accounts for human perception:

**Luminance Formula**: Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B

This formula reflects the human eye's sensitivity to different colors:
- Green contributes most to perceived brightness (58.7%)
- Red contributes moderately (29.9%)
- Blue contributes least (11.4%)

Alternative methods include:
1. **Average Method**: Simple average of R, G, B values
2. **Lightness Method**: Average of maximum and minimum color values
3. **Desaturation**: Remove saturation while preserving luminance in HSV/HSI color space

Grayscale conversion is beneficial for:
- Reducing computational complexity
- Simplifying image analysis algorithms
- Standardizing input for certain computer vision models
- Creating artistic effects

Many computer vision algorithms work on grayscale images because color information is often not necessary for detecting shapes, edges, or textures.

## Real-World Example

Medical imaging systems and document processing applications use grayscale conversion to standardize images and reduce storage requirements while maintaining diagnostic quality:

```python
import taizun as tz
import os

# Medical scan images that need standardization
medical_images = [
    "mri_brain_scan_001.png",
    "xray_chest_002.png",
    "ct_scan_abdomen_003.png",
    "ultrasound_heart_004.png"
]

print("Medical Image Standardization Pipeline:")
print("=" * 40)

# Process each medical image
for image_path in medical_images:
    try:
        # Generate output path for grayscale version
        base_name = os.path.splitext(image_path)[0]
        extension = os.path.splitext(image_path)[1]
        grayscale_path = f"{base_name}_grayscale{extension}"
        
        # Convert to grayscale
        tz.grayscale(image_path, grayscale_path)
        
        # Get file sizes for comparison
        original_size = os.path.getsize(image_path) / 1024  # KB
        grayscale_size = os.path.getsize(grayscale_path) / 1024  # KB
        size_reduction = (1 - grayscale_size / original_size) * 100
        
        print(f"Image: {image_path}")
        print(f"  Original size: {original_size:.1f}KB")
        print(f"  Grayscale size: {grayscale_size:.1f}KB")
        print(f"  Size reduction: {size_reduction:.1f}%")

    for image_path in image_list:
