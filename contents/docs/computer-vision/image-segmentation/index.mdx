Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, typically to locate objects and boundaries.

## Overview

Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments, which can help in object recognition, image compression, and medical imaging.

## Types of Segmentation

- Semantic segmentation (classifying each pixel)
- Instance segmentation (distinguishing object instances)
- Panoptic segmentation (combination of both)
- Threshold-based segmentation
- Edge-based segmentation

Image segmentation is crucial in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality applications.
