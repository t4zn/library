title: Prime Check
description: Check if a number is prime.
---

## Overview

The prime check function determines whether a given integer is a prime number, meaning it has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. This fundamental operation is essential in number theory and cryptography.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import is_prime
prime_check_num = 7
result = is_prime(prime_check_num)
print(result)
```

## Theory

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...

Key properties:
1. **Uniqueness**: 2 is the only even prime number
2. **Infinity**: There are infinitely many prime numbers
3. **Fundamental theorem**: Every integer > 1 can be expressed as a unique product of primes

Algorithmic approaches:
1. **Trial division**: Test divisibility by all numbers up to √n
2. **Optimized trial division**: Test only 2 and odd numbers up to √n
3. **Sieve methods**: Precompute primes using Eratosthenes sieve
4. **Probabilistic tests**: Miller-Rabin for very large numbers

Applications include:
- **Cryptography**: RSA encryption relies on large prime numbers
- **Hash tables**: Prime-sized tables improve distribution
- **Random number generation**: Some algorithms use primes
- **Algorithm design**: Prime factorization and number theory problems
- **Mathematical research**: Studying prime distribution and patterns
- **Computer science**: Hashing functions and data structure sizing

Implementation considerations:
- **Edge cases**: Handling numbers < 2, and the special case of 2
- **Performance**: Optimizing for large numbers with efficient algorithms
- **Precision**: Handling integer overflow for large values
- **Probabilistic vs. deterministic**: Trade-offs between speed and certainty

In programming:
```python
# Basic approach
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
