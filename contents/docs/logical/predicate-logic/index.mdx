Predicate logic, also known as first-order logic, extends propositional logic by introducing quantifiers and predicates to express more complex statements.

## Overview

Predicate logic allows for the representation of relationships between objects and the use of quantifiers to make statements about all or some objects in a domain.

## Key Concepts

- Predicates and relations
- Universal quantifier (∀)
- Existential quantifier (∃)
- Variables and constants
- Functions and terms
- Logical connectives

Predicate logic is fundamental to knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and formal verification in computer science.
