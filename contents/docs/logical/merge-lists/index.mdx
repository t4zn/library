title: Merge Lists
description: Combine two lists into one.
---

## Overview

The merge lists function combines two separate lists into a single list containing all elements from both inputs. This fundamental operation is essential for data aggregation and list manipulation.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import merge_lists
list_one = [1, 2, 3]
list_two = [4, 5, 6]
result = merge_lists(list_one, list_two)
print(result)
```

## Theory

List merging is a basic operation that creates a new sequence containing elements from multiple source sequences. The operation preserves the order of elements within each list while determining the relationship between lists.

Types of merging:
1. **Concatenation**: Simple appending of one list to another
2. **Interleaving**: Alternating elements from each list
3. **Sorted merging**: Combining sorted lists while maintaining order
4. **Union merging**: Combining lists while removing duplicates

Algorithmic approaches:
- **Direct concatenation**: O(n+m) time, creates new list
- **In-place extension**: Modifies first list, O(m) time
- **Iterator-based**: Lazy evaluation for memory efficiency
- **Recursive merging**: Functional programming approach

Considerations:
- **Order preservation**: Maintaining sequence within each original list
- **Memory efficiency**: Creating new lists vs. modifying existing ones
- **Element types**: Handling heterogeneous data types
- **Performance**: Time complexity for large lists
- **Immutability**: Whether to modify inputs or create new structures

Applications include:
- **Data aggregation**: Combining results from multiple sources
- **Batch processing**: Merging processing queues or workloads
- **Algorithm implementation**: Merge sort and other divide-and-conquer algorithms
- **User interface**: Combining selection lists or option groups
- **Database operations**: Union queries and result set combination
- **Configuration management**: Merging settings from multiple sources

Implementation considerations:
- **Edge cases**: Handling empty lists and null inputs
- **Type compatibility**: Ensuring elements can be combined
- **Memory management**: Efficient allocation and copying strategies
- **Performance optimization**: Minimizing unnecessary operations

In programming:
```python
# Python examples
# Simple concatenation
merged = list_one + list_two
# In-place extension
list_one.extend(list_two)
# Using unpacking (Python 3.5+)
merged = [*list_one, *list_two]
```
