Boolean logic is a branch of algebra in which variables can have only two values: true or false, often represented as 1 or 0.

## Overview

Boolean logic forms the foundation of digital circuit design and computer programming, providing the mathematical basis for logical operations.

## Basic Operations

- AND operation
- OR operation
- NOT operation
- XOR operation
- NAND and NOR operations

Boolean logic is essential for designing digital circuits, programming conditional statements, and implementing logical reasoning systems.
