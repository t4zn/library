Reasoning systems are computational frameworks designed to draw conclusions from knowledge bases using formal logic and inference rules.

## Overview

Reasoning systems automate the process of logical inference, enabling machines to derive new information from existing knowledge and make decisions based on logical principles.

## Types of Reasoning

- Deductive reasoning
- Inductive reasoning
- Abductive reasoning
- Non-monotonic reasoning
- Fuzzy logic reasoning

Reasoning systems are used in expert systems, knowledge-based systems, and artificial intelligence applications to solve complex problems.
