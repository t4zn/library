## Importing Taizun

The first step is to import the Taizun library:

```python
import taizun as tz
```

## Simple Function Calls

Most Taizun functions are designed to be straightforward:

```python
# Text summarization
text = "Your long text here..."
summary = tz.summarize(text)
print(summary)

# Sentiment analysis
sentiment = tz.moodscan("I love this library!")
print(sentiment)

# Named entity recognition
entities = tz.labels("Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States.")
print(entities)
```

## Chaining Operations

You can chain multiple operations together:

```python
# Clean text and then analyze sentiment
raw_text = "   This is a SAMPLE text with STOPWORDS!!!   "
clean_text = tz.scrub(raw_text)  # Remove stopwords and clean text
sentiment = tz.moodscan(clean_text)  # Analyze sentiment
print(f"Clean text: {clean_text}")
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
```

## Working with Images

Image processing functions work similarly:

```python
# Classify an image
label = tz.classify_image("path/to/image.jpg")
print(label)

# Convert to grayscale
tz.grayscale("input.jpg", "output_grayscale.jpg")

# Resize an image
tz.resize_image("input.jpg", "output_resized.jpg", size=(300, 300))
```

## Batch Processing

For processing multiple items, you can use standard Python constructs:

```python
# Process multiple texts
texts = ["Text 1", "Text 2", "Text 3"]
summaries = [tz.summarize(text) for text in texts]

# Process multiple images
image_paths = ["img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", "img3.jpg"]
labels = [tz.classify_image(path) for path in image_paths]
```

## Error Handling

Taizun functions may raise exceptions for invalid inputs:

```python
try:
    result = tz.summarize("")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

try:
    label = tz.classify_image("nonexistent.jpg")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
