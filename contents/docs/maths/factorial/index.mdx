title: Factorial
description: Calculate the factorial of a number.

## Overview

The factorial function calculates the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. This important mathematical operation appears in combinatorics, probability theory, and various algorithms.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import factorial
factorial_num = 5
result = factorial(factorial_num)
print(result)
```

## Theory

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is defined as:
- n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
- 0! = 1 (by definition)

Key properties:
1. **Growth rate**: Factorials grow extremely rapidly (faster than exponential functions)
2. **Recursive definition**: n! = n × (n-1)!
3. **Combinatorial interpretation**: n! represents the number of ways to arrange n distinct objects

Applications include:
- **Combinatorics**: Counting permutations and combinations
- **Probability theory**: Calculating probabilities in discrete distributions
- **Taylor series**: Many mathematical functions are expressed as infinite series involving factorials
- **Algorithm analysis**: Complexity analysis of certain algorithms
- **Statistical physics**: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics

Implementation considerations:
- **Overflow**: Factorials grow so quickly that even 21! exceeds the range of 64-bit integers
- **Efficiency**: Recursive implementations can be inefficient; iterative approaches are preferred
- **Special values**: Many implementations use lookup tables for small values
- **Approximation**: For large values, Stirling's approximation (n! ≈ √(2πn) × (n/e)ⁿ) is often used

In programming:
```python
# Iterative approach
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
