title: Odd Check
description: Check if a number is odd.
---

## Overview

The odd check function determines whether a given integer is not divisible by 2, meaning it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Odd numbers complement even numbers in mathematical analysis.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import is_odd
odd_check_num = 5
result = is_odd(odd_check_num)
print(result)
```

## Theory

An odd number is any integer that can be expressed in the form 2k+1, where k is an integer. When an odd number is divided by 2, the remainder is always 1.

Key properties of odd numbers:
1. **Divisibility**: Odd numbers are not divisible by 2
2. **Arithmetic**:
   - Odd ± Even = Odd
   - Odd ± Odd = Even
   - Odd × Odd = Odd
   - Odd × Even = Even
3. **Binary Representation**: Odd numbers always end in 1 in binary

In programming, checking if a number is odd is typically done using the modulo operator (%):
```python
is_odd = (number % 2) == 1
```

Alternatively, it can be determined by checking if it's not even:
```python
is_odd = not is_even(number)
```

Bitwise operations provide an efficient method:
```python
is_odd = (number & 1) == 1
```

Odd numbers are significant in:
- Mathematical proofs (especially in induction)
- Number theory (prime numbers greater than 2 are odd)
- Computer graphics (checkerboard patterns alternate based on odd/even coordinates)
- Signal processing (odd functions have specific symmetry properties)
- Game theory (some strategies depend on odd/even turn counts)
