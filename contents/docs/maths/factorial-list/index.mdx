title: Factorial List
description: Calculate the factorial of each number in a list.
---

## Overview

The factorial list function applies the factorial operation to each element in a collection of numbers, returning a new list with the factorial values. This vectorized operation is useful for batch processing mathematical computations.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import factorial_list
factorial_nums = [3, 4, 5]
result = factorial_list(factorial_nums)
print(result)
```

## Theory

The factorial list operation extends the scalar factorial function to operate on collections, applying f(n) = n! to each element. This represents a mapping operation in functional programming terms.

Key considerations:
1. **Element-wise operation**: Each input element is processed independently
2. **Domain restrictions**: Factorials are only defined for non-negative integers
3. **Growth characteristics**: Output values grow extremely rapidly
4. **Memory usage**: Results may require larger data types than inputs

Mathematical properties:
- **Injectivity**: The factorial function is strictly increasing for n â‰¥ 1
- **Combinatorial interpretation**: Each result represents arrangements of n objects
- **Sequence generation**: Creates the factorial number sequence [1!, 2!, 3!, ...]

Applications include:
- **Combinatorics**: Calculating permutations for multiple set sizes
- **Probability**: Computing coefficients in binomial and multinomial distributions
- **Algorithm analysis**: Determining complexity bounds for recursive algorithms
- **Mathematical research**: Generating sequences for number theory investigations
- **Statistical physics**: Computing partition functions and state counts

Implementation considerations:
- **Overflow handling**: Rapid growth requires careful data type selection
- **Caching**: Precomputed values can improve performance for repeated calculations
- **Validation**: Input checking for negative or non-integer values
- **Parallelization**: Independent calculations can be distributed across threads

In programming:
```python
# Using list comprehension
def factorial_list(numbers):
    return [factorial(n) for n in numbers]
# or map function
def factorial_list(numbers):
    return list(map(factorial, numbers))
```
