## Overview

The calculator function performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a simple interface for mathematical computations.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import calculator
num1, num2 = 10, 5
operation_type = 'add'
result = calculator(num1, num2, operation_type)
print(result)
```

## Theory

Basic arithmetic operations form the foundation of mathematical computation:

1. **Addition (+)**: Combines two numbers to produce a sum. Commutative and associative operation.

2. **Subtraction (-)**: Finds the difference between two numbers. Neither commutative nor associative.

3. **Multiplication (ร)**: Repeated addition of one number by another. Commutative and associative operation.

4. **Division (รท)**: Determines how many times one number is contained within another. Neither commutative nor associative.

In computer implementations, special considerations include:
- Handling division by zero errors
- Managing floating-point precision
- Dealing with integer overflow
- Supporting different number types (integers, floats, complex numbers)

Modern calculators often implement additional features like:
- Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
- Parenthetical expressions
- Scientific functions (exponents, roots, logarithms)
- Memory functions for storing intermediate results
