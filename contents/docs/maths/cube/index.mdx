description: Calculate the cube of a number.

## Overview

The cube function calculates the result of multiplying a number by itself three times. This mathematical operation is fundamental in geometry, physics, and various computational algorithms.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import cube
cube_num = 2
result = cube(cube_num)
print(result)
```

## Theory

Cubing a number n means computing n³ = n × n × n. This operation has several mathematical properties:

1. **Sign preservation**: The cube of a positive number is positive, and the cube of a negative number is negative
2. **Monotonicity**: If a > b, then a³ > b³ (unlike squaring, this holds for all real numbers)
3. **Inverse relationship**: The cube root function (∛x) is the inverse of the cube function

Geometric interpretation:
- The cube of a number represents the volume of a cube with sides of that length
- In three-dimensional space, cubic relationships describe volume scaling

Applications include:
- **Geometry**: Volume calculations for cubes and other 3D shapes
- **Physics**: Density calculations, moment of inertia, and other cubic relationships
- **Computer graphics**: 3D scaling transformations and volume calculations
- **Engineering**: Stress-strain relationships in materials (Hooke's law extensions)
- **Economics**: Production functions with cubic cost relationships

In programming, cubing can be implemented as:
```python
cube = number * number * number
# or
cube = number ** 3
# or
cube = pow(number, 3)
```

For performance-critical applications, direct multiplication is typically faster than exponentiation functions.
