title: Min Value
description: Find the minimum value between two numbers.
---

## Overview

The min value function compares two numbers and returns the smaller of the two. This fundamental operation is essential in algorithms, optimization, and data analysis.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import min_val
min_num, max_num = 5, 10
result = min_val(min_num, max_num)
print(result)
```

## Theory

The minimum function is a basic comparison operation that determines the lesser of two values according to a defined ordering. For real numbers, this corresponds to the standard numerical ordering.

Key properties:
1. **Commutativity**: min(a, b) = min(b, a)
2. **Associativity**: min(a, min(b, c)) = min(min(a, b), c)
3. **Idempotence**: min(a, a) = a
4. **Identity**: min(a, ∞) = a (where ∞ represents positive infinity)

Generalizations:
- **Multiple values**: The minimum of a set of values is the smallest element
- **Functions**: Pointwise minimum of functions: min(f(x), g(x))
- **Vectors**: Component-wise minimum operations
- **Sets**: The infimum (greatest lower bound) generalizes minimum to infinite sets

Applications include:
- **Algorithm design**: Finding minimum elements in arrays and data structures
- **Optimization**: Objective functions often seek to minimize cost or error
- **Graphics**: Clamping values to minimum bounds
- **Statistics**: Determining the range and outliers in datasets
- **Game theory**: Minimax algorithms for decision making
- **Control systems**: Saturation functions that enforce minimum limits

Implementation considerations:
- **Data types**: Handling different numeric types (integers, floats, complex numbers)
- **Special values**: Behavior with NaN, infinity, and negative zero
- **Performance**: Branchless implementations using bit manipulation for critical code paths

In programming:
```python
# Built-in functions
result = min(a, b)
# or conditional expressions
result = a if a < b else b
```
