## Overview

The average function calculates the arithmetic mean of a collection of numbers by summing all values and dividing by the count. This fundamental statistical measure represents the central tendency of data.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import avg
number_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = avg(number_list)
print(result)
```

## Theory

The arithmetic mean (average) of a set of n numbers is defined as:
Average = (sum of all numbers) / (count of numbers)

Key properties:
1. **Linearity**: avg(a·X + b) = a·avg(X) + b for constants a, b
2. **Range**: The average lies between the minimum and maximum values
3. **Sensitivity**: All data points contribute equally to the average
4. **Units**: The average has the same units as the original data

Types of averages:
- **Arithmetic mean**: Standard average (sum/count)
- **Geometric mean**: nth root of product of n numbers
- **Harmonic mean**: Reciprocal of average of reciprocals
- **Weighted mean**: Accounts for different importance of values

Applications include:
- **Statistics**: Central tendency measure in data analysis
- **Signal processing**: DC component extraction from signals
- **Finance**: Average returns, prices, and performance metrics
- **Quality control**: Process mean monitoring
- **Machine learning**: Feature normalization and batch processing
- **Physics**: Center of mass calculations

Considerations:
- **Outliers**: Extreme values can significantly skew the average
- **Missing data**: Handling NaN or undefined values
- **Precision**: Floating-point arithmetic considerations
- **Empty sets**: Defining behavior for zero-length collections

In programming:
```python
# Standard implementation
def average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers) if numbers else 0
```
