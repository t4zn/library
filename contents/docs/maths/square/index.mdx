description: Calculate the square of a number.

## Overview

The square function calculates the result of multiplying a number by itself. This fundamental mathematical operation appears in numerous formulas and algorithms across various fields.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import square
square_num = 3
result = square(square_num)
print(result)
```

## Theory

Squaring a number n means computing n² = n × n. This operation has several important mathematical properties:

1. **Non-negativity**: The square of any real number is non-negative (n² ≥ 0)
2. **Symmetry**: (-n)² = n², meaning squares of opposite numbers are equal
3. **Monotonicity**: For non-negative numbers, if a > b, then a² > b²

Geometric interpretation:
- The square of a number represents the area of a square with sides of that length
- In the Cartesian plane, y = x² forms a parabola opening upward

Applications include:
- **Distance calculations**: Euclidean distance formula uses squares
- **Statistics**: Variance and standard deviation calculations
- **Physics**: Kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²) and other quadratic relationships
- **Computer graphics**: Lighting calculations and distance-based effects
- **Optimization**: Many objective functions are quadratic

In programming, squaring can be implemented as:
```python
square = number * number
# or
square = number ** 2
# or
square = pow(number, 2)
```

For large numbers, direct multiplication is typically more efficient than using exponentiation functions.
