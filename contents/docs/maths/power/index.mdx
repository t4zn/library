## Overview

The power function calculates the result of raising a base number to an exponent. This fundamental mathematical operation generalizes multiplication and appears in numerous scientific and engineering applications.

## Usage

```python
from taizun import power
base_num, exponent_num = 2, 3
result = power(base_num, exponent_num)
print(result)
```

## Theory

Exponentiation is a mathematical operation involving two numbers: the base (b) and the exponent (n), written as bⁿ. It represents repeated multiplication of the base:
- bⁿ = b × b × ... × b (n times when n is a positive integer)

Key properties:
1. **Laws of exponents**:
   - bᵐ × bⁿ = bᵐ⁺ⁿ
   - (bᵐ)ⁿ = bᵐⁿ
   - (b × c)ⁿ = bⁿ × cⁿ
2. **Special cases**:
   - b⁰ = 1 (for b ≠ 0)
   - b¹ = b
   - b⁻ⁿ = 1/bⁿ

Extensions to other number types:
- **Negative exponents**: Represent reciprocals
- **Fractional exponents**: Represent roots (b^(1/n) = √ⁿb)
- **Real exponents**: Defined using limits and logarithms
- **Complex exponents**: Defined using Euler's formula

Applications include:
- **Compound interest**: Financial calculations with exponential growth
- **Population modeling**: Biological and ecological growth models
- **Physics**: Wave functions, decay processes, and inverse square laws
- **Computer science**: Algorithm complexity analysis and cryptographic functions
- **Engineering**: Signal processing and control systems

Implementation considerations:
- **Efficiency**: Exponentiation by squaring provides O(log n) algorithms
- **Precision**: Floating-point arithmetic can introduce rounding errors
- **Domain restrictions**: Negative bases with fractional exponents may be undefined in real numbers

In programming:
```python
# Using built-in operators
result = base ** exponent
# or
result = pow(base, exponent)
```
