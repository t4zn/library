Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation, essential for understanding optimization and machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

Calculus involves the study of continuous change and has two major branches: differential calculus (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves) and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of quantities and areas under curves).

## Key Areas

- Differential calculus
- Integral calculus
- Multivariable calculus
- Partial derivatives
- Gradient descent

Calculus is fundamental to optimization algorithms used in machine learning and deep learning.
