This guide covers the essential configuration options and best practices.\n\n## Basic Configuration\n\nTaizun requires minimal configuration to get started. Most functions work out of the box with sensible defaults.\n\n```python\nimport taizun as tz\n\n# Most functions work without any configuration\nresult = tz.summarize_text(\"Your text here...\")\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nFor advanced usage, you can configure Taizun using environment variables:\n\n```bash\nexport TAIZUN_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/models     # Path to custom models\nexport TAIZUN_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache       # Cache directory for downloaded models\nexport TAIZUN_LOG_LEVEL=INFO                 # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)\n```\n\n## Model Configuration\n\nSome Taizun functions use pre-trained models. You can configure which models to use:\n\n```python\nimport taizun as tz\n\n# Configure NLP models\ntz.config.nlp_model = \"bert-base-uncased\"    # For text processing\ntz.config.sentiment_model = \"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\"\n\n# Configure Computer Vision models\ntz.config.cv_model = \"resnet50\"              # For image classification\n```\n\n## Performance Settings\n\nOptimize Taizun for your specific use case:\n\n```python\nimport taizun as tz\n\n# Enable/disable GPU acceleration\ntz.config.use_gpu = True                     # Default: auto-detect\n\n# Set batch sizes for processing multiple items\ntz.config.batch_size = 32                    # Default: 16\n\n# Configure caching\ntz.config.enable_caching = True              # Default: True\ntz.config.cache_size = 1000                  # Default: 100\n```\n\n## Logging Configuration\n\nControl the verbosity of Taizun's logging:\n\n```python\nimport taizun as tz\nimport logging\n\n# Set logging level\ntz.set_log_level(logging.INFO)\n\n# Disable logging entirely\ntz.set_log_level(logging.CRITICAL)\n\n# Custom logger\ncustom_logger = logging.getLogger(\"my_taizun\")\ntz.set_logger(custom_logger)\n```\n\n## Resource Management\n\nManage system resources used by Taizun:\n\n```python\nimport taizun as tz\n\n# Limit memory usage\ntz.config.max_memory = \"2GB\"                 # Default: None (no limit)\n\n# Control number of CPU threads\ntz.config.num_threads = 4                    # Default: auto-detect\n\n# Clean up resources\ntz.cleanup()                                 # Free memory and close models\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\nFor complex applications, you can customize Taizun's behavior:\n\n```python\nimport taizun as tz\n\n# Custom preprocessing functions\ndef custom_preprocessor(text):\n    # Your preprocessing logic here\n    return text.lower().strip()\n\ntz.config.preprocessor = custom_preprocessor\n\n# Custom postprocessing functions\ndef custom_postprocessor(result):\n    # Your postprocessing logic here\n    return result\n\ntz.config.postprocessor = custom_postprocessor\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\nWhen using Taizun in larger projects, consider this structure:\n\n```\nmy_project/\n├── main.py              # Your main application\n├── config.py            # Taizun configuration\n├── data/                # Data files\n├── models/              # Custom models (if any)\n└── utils/               # Helper functions\n```\n",

The main approaches include:\n\n1. **Traditional Methods**: Early approaches used handcrafted features like SIFT, HOG, or color histograms combined with classifiers like SVM or Random Forest.\n\n2. **Deep Learning**: Modern approaches use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that automatically learn relevant features from raw pixel data. Architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet have achieved remarkable performance.\n\n3. **Vision Transformers**: Recent advances use transformer architectures adapted for vision tasks. Vision Transformers (ViT) divide images into patches and process them with self-attention mechanisms, often achieving state-of-the-art results.\n\nThe training process requires a large dataset of labeled images. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and color adjustments are often used to improve model generalization. Transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a specific task, is commonly used to achieve good results with limited data.\n",

These lists vary by language and application domain.\n\n2. **Filtering**: Removing identified stopwords from the text while preserving the structure and meaning of the remaining content.\n\n3. **Language Considerations**: Different languages have different sets of stopwords. For example, English stopwords include \"the\", \"and\", \"or\", while other languages have their own common function words.\n\nThe effectiveness of stopword removal depends on the specific application.

This includes tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removing stop words.\n\n## Key Techniques\n\n* Tokenization\n* Stemming and Lemmatization\n* Stop Word Removal\n* Text Normalization\n* Part-of-Speech Tagging\n\nThese techniques form the foundation for more advanced NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.\n\n## Detailed Theory\n\n### Tokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, phrases, or sentences. Proper tokenization is crucial as it directly affects the performance of downstream NLP tasks.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfrom taizun import tokenize_text\ntokens = tokenize_text(\"Hello world, how are you?\")\nprint(tokens)\n# Output: ['Hello', 'world', ',', 'how', 'are', 'you', '?']\n```\n\n### Stemming and Lemmatization\n\nStemming reduces words to their root form by removing suffixes (e.g., \"running\" → \"run\"). Lemmatization is more sophisticated, reducing words to their base or dictionary form (lemma) using vocabulary and morphological analysis.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfrom taizun import stem_text, lemmatize_text\ntext = \"The children are playing happily\"\nstemmed = stem_text(text)\nlemmatized = lemmatize_text(text)\nprint(stemmed)\nprint(lemmatized)\n```\n\n### Stop Word Removal\n\nStop words are common words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"at\") that often provide little meaningful information. Removing them can reduce noise and improve processing efficiency.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfrom taizun import remove_stopwords\ncleaned_text = remove_stopwords(\"This is a sample text with stopwords.\")\nprint(cleaned_text)\n# Output: \"sample text stopwords.\"\n```\n\n### Text Normalization\n\nText normalization involves converting text into a standard format, including lowercasing, removing punctuation, and handling special characters. This ensures consistency in text processing.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfrom taizun import normalize_text\nnormalized = normalize_text(\"Hello WORLD!!!
